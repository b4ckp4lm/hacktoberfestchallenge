# Hacktoberfest Challenge 2018! (An exciting way of helping ICSE Computer Application students!)
Welcome to this years Hacktoberfest challenge. 
This year, I want to try and help those ICSE kids having a hard time with JAVA. All the codes posted in this repo are basically the most common and easy ICSE Java questions asked in tests. Feel free to add more, relevant codes.

Also note that any sort of spam will be reported. So, be smart and post proper, working codes.

That being said, all the very best for this years challenge!

Please make a folder and post your codes in it. You can write programs for ANYTHING in ANY language all though, we prefer JAVA to help the students. Just make sure you PR working codes to avoid any issues. 
Thanks and happy hacking <3!
